    A convolution is said to be "depthwise" when channel i of the output is only computed by passing the filter overing channel i of the input.
    In torch, this is done by setting groups=number of channels.
    Because it is not yet implemented in MLX, a workaround is to zero out the weights of a conv object initialized with groups=1 (groups=1 is when output channel i is computing by passing the filter over all input channels)
    To do that, we need to zero out all elements except those on the "diagonal":
    for channels=8 and kernel_size=4, the weights are (8, 4, 8).
    these are composed of 8 x (8, 4, 1) filter, each of those is used to compute one output channel.
    this (8, 4, 1) filter is composed of 8 x (1, 4, 1) filter, each of those is passed over each input channel.
    so we need to set to 0 all those 8 filters, except the one which corresponds to the output channel of these 8 filters (so that the channels don't mix)
